# Guidelines

This document works to define the basic rules and procedures to be able to construct guidelines that will serve to certify the quality or goodness of an output produced by a software in the form of a text flow better understood as Terminal Output, Console Output or Shell Output. This in relation to who will be the user of the generated content, whether it is a human (in a specific role) or a machine.

## Aspects

To introduce criteria for evaluating the output, the following Aspects are defined

- Human Readbility
- Machine Readbility
- Output Height

### Human Readbility

It represents the predisposition of a flow of text to be read by a human.

### Machine Readbility

It represents the predisposition of a flow of text to be read by a machine.

### Output Height

The **Output Height** is the amount of number of lines were an output is made of.
It can be considered a factor for measuring the quality of the output for the same message transferred. 
In general it is considered valid to express messages to the user avoiding using lines of text more than necessary.

## Defining Process

The definition process has the purpose of giving rise to proposals for guidelines.
Currently anyone who wants to propose a new guideline will be able to do a Pull-request of a new file into directory `draft/`

The file must be inspired to this example (You have the freedom to add whatever is necessary to make the description clearer and more complete)

- https://github.com/francescobianco/shell-output-guidelines/blob/main/draft/draft-example.md

The file must named in lowercase with and the name must refer to the content of guideline (eg. avoid-qustion-mark-at-begin-of-a-line.md)

## Decision Process

The decision process aims to convert a guideline proposal to make it official, it will be assigned an identification number preceded by the prefix `SOG`

Currently anyone who wants to convert a guideline can be able to do a Pull-request of a new file into directory `guidelines/`
